## Creating files and folders 

Touch command to create files Mkdir command to create folders.

### Touch command -- creates new empty files 

touch file1 = creates a file1 in the current folder you are in

touch \~/Documents/distantFile = creates distantFile in the Documents
folder

### create files with content in them use the echo command

echo "hello" \> hello.txt = creates a hello.txt file with the text hello
inside

### mkdir command -- creating folders/directories 

make directories -- mkdir

mkdir folder -- will make a folder named folder in the current path you
are in

mkdir \~/Pictures/holiday = make a directory in our pictures folder
called holiday

### Create entire folder paths all in one go

Mkdir bla/thing/shablam -- will return error:

We need to use the mkdir -p then bla/thing/shablam = the p will make a
whole new path

Never leave spaces between your names of your files or folders as it
creates them as an individual files or folders because the cli will
understand 2 cli arguments rather have na \_ or -- between (mainly do
this it is more simpler with tab auto completion) OR if your file or
folder needs to have a space then put it in quotations "happy birthday "
and It will then work. Folders and filenames are case sensitive in
Linux.

### Brace{...} expansion -- create more than 100 files or folders in 1 command

-   Create the first folder in the folder you want to be in

-   Then navigate into your folder where you will create many more
    inside

-   We want to create folders like Jan 2020, Feb 2020, Mar 2020 etc
    until Dec 2025 and so for 5 years each of them to have folders
    inside

-   Use of brace expansion it will basically expand the 2 brackets like
    algebra expansion mkdir {...}\_{....} so we will get all the months
    of 2020, 2021 etc as folders

height="2.41667760279965in"} instead of typing out each othe the dates
we could of done {2020..2025}, it could be {A..Z} or {a..z}or {b..g}

-   Create 100 files in each of these folders -- use brace expansion

-   Go into your project folder in the desktop type the propt below
    which means for each of the files jan to dec for the 5 years create
    the files 1 to 100 in each folders

height="2.798611111111111in"} completed doing the files in alphabetical
order

![](vertopal_10d9ff7cfb7c47c09a5ae76375588473/media/image9.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="0.5763888888888888in"} - we can rake all that standard output
and send to the file called out.txt

### Simple brace expansion case
