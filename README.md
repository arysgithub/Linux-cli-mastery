# Linux-cli-mastery
This repository documents my **Linux Command Line Interface (CLI) deep dive** as part of my **18-Week DevOps in Public Challenge**.

## 📌 Why This Project?

As I dive deeper into DevOps, I’m refreshing and expanding my knowledge of Linux and CLI tools — core pillars for any DevOps engineer. While I had solid exposure to Bash, GitLab, and terminal operations from university projects, this journey will help deepen that understanding and apply it practically in a DevOps context.

## 🗓️ Daily Logs for Linux

Logs are organised by day in the [`/logs`](./logs) folder:
- [Day 1: Linux Basics & Terminal Setup](logs/Day1_Linux_Basics.md)

---

This course will guide me through:

1. **Mastering the Linux Terminal**  
   - Terminal vs. shell, I/O, redirection, pipelines, and using `man` pages.

2. **Mastering the Linux File System**  
   - Creating, deleting, copying, compressing, navigating, and sorting files/folders.

3. **Task Automation & Scheduling**  
   - Writing Bash scripts and automating tasks using `cron`.

4. **Package Managers & Repositories**  
   - Installing/updating software, exploring repositories, and compiling from source.

## 💻 My Setup

## 🧠 Reflections

Already had more CLI experience than I thought — from uploading assignments using Git CLI to navigating file systems for university projects. Now it’s time to structure and scale it.

Stay tuned for daily logs, deeper scripting, and automation insights!
